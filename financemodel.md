The 50/30/20 finance model is a budgeting guideline that suggests allocating your after-tax income into three categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. Here are examples of each category:
Needs (50%)

These are essential expenses that you must pay to maintain a basic standard of living. Examples include:

    Housing: Rent or mortgage payments
    Utilities: Electricity, water, gas, and internet bills
    Groceries: Basic food and household supplies
    Transportation: Car payments, public transportation costs, or fuel
    Insurance: Health, auto, and home insurance premiums
    Healthcare: Medical expenses and medications

Wants (30%)

These are non-essential expenses that enhance your lifestyle but are not necessary for survival. Examples include:

    Dining Out: Restaurant meals and takeout
    Entertainment: Movies, concerts, and streaming services
    Travel: Vacations and weekend getaways
    Hobbies: Sports, crafts, or other leisure activities
    Luxury Items: Designer clothing, gadgets, or accessories
    Subscriptions: Magazines, premium apps, or memberships

Savings and Debt Repayment (20%)

This category focuses on building your financial future and managing debt. Examples include:

    Savings: Contributions to an emergency fund, retirement accounts, or investment accounts
    Debt Repayment: Payments towards credit card debt, student loans, or personal loans
    Long-term Goals: Saving for a home, education, or major purchases

By following this model, you can create a balanced budget that addresses your essential needs, allows for personal enjoyment, and promotes financial stability through savings and debt management.
